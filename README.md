# Quarterly Report Dashboard

A live marketing analytics dashboard built for three sister staffing agencies — **Integrated Staffing (ISL)**, **Accountant Staffing (AS)**, and **Administrative Staffing (ADS)**. Data lives in Supabase and is edited through a built-in admin, with three report views per agency: Social Media, Website, and Trends.

---

## What it does

Each quarter, this dashboard gives a single source of truth for how each agency is performing across its digital channels. Rather than exporting spreadsheets or building static slide decks, the data lives in Supabase and the dashboard reads it live, so the numbers are always current.

**Three views, one app:**

- **Social Media** — KPIs (impressions, engagements, followers, etc.), quarter-by-quarter KPI chart, platform-by-platform breakdown, top posts, a searchable/filterable all-posts table with calendar view, and editor's insights
- **Website** — traffic KPIs, channel breakdown (organic, direct, referral, paid, social), top pages with deltas vs. prior quarter
- **Trends** — quarter-over-quarter trajectory for key metrics, with a pace-based projection for where the current quarter will finish
- **Admin** (`/admin`) — magic-link sign-in, tabbed forms for every section of both report types, CSV import for the post log, unsaved-changes guards

Any combination of agency and quarter is a URL. You can switch between them instantly without a page reload.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the Supabase URL + anon key
npm install
npm run dev
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the project |
| `npm test` | Vitest (formatting, quarter calendar, projection math) |
| `npm run format` | Prettier over `src/` |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, tests, and a build on every push and PR. Deployment is handled by Cloudflare Pages from the repo.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | yes | Supabase anon (publishable) key — safe client-side; RLS is the access control |
| `VITE_ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL` | no | If set, runtime errors are POSTed as JSON to this URL in production |

## How the data flows

All report data lives in Supabase Postgres (`social_reports`, `web_reports`, and their child tables, plus `projection_snapshots` for trends history). The public report pages read with the anon key under row-level security; the admin writes after a magic-link sign-in.

Data fetching is resilient by default: transient failures retry with exponential backoff, reports are cached for the session and revalidated in the background (so switching agency/quarter is instant), and error states distinguish offline from service failures. The Trends view refreshes every 5 minutes while the tab is visible.

`migrate-from-sheets.js` is the one-off script that migrated the original Google Sheets data into Supabase; it's kept for reference.

## URL structure

The entire app state lives in URL params. Sharing or bookmarking a URL always opens the exact same view.

| Param | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `agency` | `isl` · `as` · `ads` | `isl` |
| `quarter` | `q1` · `q2` · `q3` · `q4` | current quarter |
| `view` | `social` · `web` · `trends` | `social` |

**Examples:**
```
/?agency=as&quarter=q2&view=web        → Accountant Staffing, Q2, Website view
/?agency=ads&view=trends               → Administrative Staffing, Trends view
```

## Adding a new quarter

Nothing to do. The dashboard detects the current quarter automatically (pinned to `America/Halifax` so every viewer sees the same default, regardless of their local clock) and generates `QUARTERS` and `TRENDS_QUARTERS` at runtime. When a new quarter starts, the nav defaults to it and the Trends page rolls forward — no code changes.

The fiscal calendar is defined in `src/config.js` as `Q_DEFS` (fiscal year starts September):

```js
const Q_DEFS = [
  { suffix: "q1", label: "Q1", startM: 8,  endM: 11, range: "Sep–Nov" },
  { suffix: "q2", label: "Q2", startM: 11, endM: 2,  range: "Dec–Feb" },
  { suffix: "q3", label: "Q3", startM: 2,  endM: 5,  range: "Mar–May" },
  { suffix: "q4", label: "Q4", startM: 5,  endM: 8,  range: "Jun–Aug" },
];
```

`startM`/`endM` are 0-indexed months; `endM` is the exclusive boundary. The quarter boundary logic is covered by tests in `src/config.test.js`.

---

## Adding a new agency

Open `src/config.js` and add an entry to `AGENCIES`:

```js
export const AGENCIES = {
  isl: { label: "ISL", name: "Integrated Staffing",     prefix: "isl", url: "https://integratedstaffing.ca" },
  // new: { label: "NEW", name: "New Agency", prefix: "new", url: "https://newagency.ca" },
};
```

Then in `editorial.css` add a badge colour and (optionally) an accent override:

```css
.agency-badge-new { background: #2d6a4f; }
body[data-agency="new"] { --accent: #2d6a4f; }
```

The agency appears in the switcher immediately; data hooks and the admin pick it up automatically. Make sure rows exist in Supabase under the new agency key.

## Current-quarter pace projections (Trends view)

The Trends page projects where the current quarter will finish before it ends, using a blended model of three signals — simple rate (total ÷ days elapsed), a 7-day rolling rate, and a linear regression over daily snapshots — with weights that shift toward the data-driven signals as the quarter matures. Early in the quarter the projection is anchored toward the prior quarter's daily rate, and a calibration factor learned from the previous quarter's projection accuracy nudges the result. Snapshots are stored in the `projection_snapshots` table whenever the Trends page loads.

The model is pure-function code in `src/hooks/useTrendsData.js`, covered by tests in `src/hooks/useTrendsData.test.js`.

---

## Deployment

The app builds to a static bundle with no server-side requirements (`npm run build` → `dist/`). Hosting is Cloudflare Pages with `public/_redirects` handling SPA routing; any static host works. Set the two Supabase environment variables in the host's build settings.
