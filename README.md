# Quarterly Report Dashboard

A live marketing analytics dashboard built for three sister staffing agencies — **Integrated Staffing (ISL)**, **Accountant Staffing (AS)**, and **Administrative Staffing (ADS)**. Data lives in Supabase and is edited through a built-in admin, with three report views per agency: Social Media, Website, and Trends.

---

## What it does

Each quarter, this dashboard gives a single source of truth for how each agency is performing across its digital channels. Rather than exporting spreadsheets or building static slide decks, the data lives in Supabase and the dashboard reads it live, so the numbers are always current.

**Three views, one app:**

- **Social Media** — KPIs (impressions, engagements, followers, etc.), quarter-by-quarter KPI chart, platform-by-platform breakdown, top posts, a searchable/filterable all-posts table with calendar view, and editor's insights
- **Website** — traffic KPIs, channel breakdown (organic, direct, referral, paid, social), top pages with deltas vs. prior quarter, and a contact-forms section (submission KPIs, weekly trend by intent, branch + source breakdowns, day×hour heatmap) fed by aggregate-only stats so no submitter PII reaches the public page
- **Trends** — quarter-over-quarter trajectory for key metrics, with a pace-based projection for where the current quarter will finish
- **Admin** (`/admin`) — magic-link sign-in, tabbed forms for every section of both report types, CSV import for the post log, unsaved-changes guards, and a Submissions tab (auth-only, since rows carry PII) with contact-form CSV import (dedup-safe re-imports), an employer-lead spotlight, and a searchable/filterable submissions table

Any combination of agency and quarter is a URL. You can switch between them instantly without a page reload.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | yes | Supabase anon (publishable) key — safe client-side; RLS is the access control |

## How the data flows

All report data lives in Supabase Postgres (`social_reports`, `web_reports`, and their child tables, plus `projection_snapshots` for trends history). The public report pages read with the anon key under row-level security; the admin writes after a magic-link sign-in.

Data fetching is resilient by default: transient failures retry with exponential backoff, reports are cached for the session and revalidated in the background (so switching agency/quarter is instant), and error states distinguish offline from service failures. The Trends view refreshes every 5 minutes while the tab is visible.

`migrate-from-sheets.js` is the one-off script that migrated the original Google Sheets data into Supabase; it's kept for reference.

## Website report data entry

Website figures are entered by hand in the admin, read off the GA4 interface once a quarter. There is no automated ingestion; an attempt at it was removed because the setup it required (a Google Cloud service account, a credential store, a scheduled job) was far more machinery than the task justified.

**Where the numbers come from.** Open GA4 for the property, set the date range to the fiscal quarter, and read off:

| Field | GA4 location |
|---|---|
| Total Visits | Sessions |
| Unique Users | Total users |
| Engagement Rate | Engagement rate (enter as a percentage, e.g. `54.2`) |
| Avg Time on Site | Average engagement time per session (enter as seconds) |
| Traffic channels | Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition, by *Session default channel group*. GA4's "Organic Social" is entered as "Social" to match the report's own naming. |
| Top pages | Reports → Engagement → Pages and screens |

`Campaign Clicks` and `Form Submissions` have no GA4 equivalent and never did. Campaign clicks are counted from the ad platforms; form submissions come from the contact-form CSV import on the Submissions tab.

**Saving is atomic.** `save_web_report(payload jsonb)` writes the report row and all four child tables in one transaction, so a failure partway through cannot leave a half-written quarter on the server. It merges on **key presence** — a key absent from the payload leaves the stored column untouched — but the admin form deliberately sends every section on every save, so a field you clear actually clears.

**Quarters are keyed by fiscal year.** `web_reports` is unique on `(agency, quarter, year)`. Without the year, saving Q1 of a new fiscal year would land on the previous year's Q1 row and overwrite it, taking its channels and pages with it. The fiscal year starts in September and a quarter is labelled with the calendar year of its last day.

## URL structure

The entire app state lives in URL params. Sharing or bookmarking a URL always opens the exact same view.

| Param | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `agency` | `isl` · `as` · `ads` | `isl` |
| `quarter` | `q1` · `q2` · `q3` · `q4` | current quarter |
| `view` | `social` · `web` · `trends` | `social` |

**Examples:**
```
/?agency=as&quarter=q2&view=web        → Accountant Staffing, Q2, Website view
/?agency=ads&view=trends               → Administrative Staffing, Trends view
```

## Adding a new quarter

Nothing to do. The dashboard detects the current quarter automatically (pinned to `America/Halifax` so every viewer sees the same default, regardless of their local clock) and generates `QUARTERS` and `TRENDS_QUARTERS` at runtime. When a new quarter starts, the nav defaults to it and the Trends page rolls forward — no code changes.

The fiscal calendar is defined in `src/config.js` as `Q_DEFS` (fiscal year starts September):

```js
const Q_DEFS = [
  { suffix: "q1", label: "Q1", startM: 8,  endM: 11, range: "Sep–Nov" },
  { suffix: "q2", label: "Q2", startM: 11, endM: 2,  range: "Dec–Feb" },
  { suffix: "q3", label: "Q3", startM: 2,  endM: 5,  range: "Mar–May" },
  { suffix: "q4", label: "Q4", startM: 5,  endM: 8,  range: "Jun–Aug" },
];
```

`startM`/`endM` are 0-indexed months; `endM` is the exclusive boundary. The quarter boundary logic is covered by tests in `src/config.test.js`.

---

## Adding a new agency

Open `src/config.js` and add an entry to `AGENCIES`:

```js
export const AGENCIES = {
  isl: { label: "ISL", name: "Integrated Staffing",     prefix: "isl", url: "https://integratedstaffing.ca" },
  // new: { label: "NEW", name: "New Agency", prefix: "new", url: "https://newagency.ca" },
};
```

Then in `editorial.css` add a badge colour and (optionally) an accent override:

```css
.agency-badge-new { background: #2d6a4f; }
body[data-agency="new"] { --accent: #2d6a4f; }
```

The agency appears in the switcher immediately; data hooks and the admin pick it up automatically. Make sure rows exist in Supabase under the new agency key.

---

## Current-quarter pace projections (Trends view)

The Trends page projects where the current quarter will finish before it ends, using a blended model of three signals — simple rate (total ÷ days elapsed), a 7-day rolling rate, and a linear regression over daily snapshots — with weights that shift toward the data-driven signals as the quarter matures. Early in the quarter the projection is anchored toward the prior quarter's daily rate, and a calibration factor learned from the previous quarter's projection accuracy nudges the result. Snapshots are stored in the `projection_snapshots` table whenever the Trends page loads.

The model is pure-function code in `src/hooks/useTrendsData.js`, covered by tests in `src/hooks/useTrendsData.test.js`.

---

## Post-click journeys (Paid Media view)

The Paid Media view carries the click through to the site: for each campaign — and, if you'd rather report on paid traffic as a whole, for the account — an "After the click" block shows how many sessions landed, how many moved past the landing page, how deep they got, and how many converted, over a flow diagram of the traffic step by step and a table of the actual routes.

One row of `paid_media_click_paths` is one journey: the ordered pages a group of sessions visited, and how many sessions took exactly that route. A journey ends where the session ended, so drop-off is a fact of the data rather than a separate figure to keep in step. Everything on the page — landing pages, the flow, the leak at each step, the ranked journeys — is derived from that (`src/lib/clickPaths.js`, tested in `clickPaths.test.js`).

Enter them in **Admin → Social → Paid Media**, either per campaign or in the site-wide block underneath. Importing replaces that scope's journeys, since an export describes all of its scope's traffic and merging one in twice would double every session. Three input shapes are read:

| Source | Shape |
|---|---|
| `GA4 → Explore → Path exploration`, exported as CSV | one column per step (`STEP +0`, `STEP +1`, …) plus a sessions column |
| Any sheet with a route column | `Page path, Sessions, Key events` — route delimited by `>`, `->`, `→` or `\|` |
| Rows pasted from a spreadsheet | `/warehouse-jobs > /jobs > /apply` ⇥ `120` ⇥ `8`, no header needed |

Hosts, query strings and hashes are dropped (`/jobs?loc=halifax` → `/jobs`), repeated pages collapse, and end-of-session markers like `(not set)` end the route. Past 150 journeys the tail is summed into one "other" row, which counts toward the session total so shares stay honest but isn't drawn.

---

## Deployment

The app builds to a static bundle with no server-side requirements (`npm run build` → `dist/`). Hosting is Cloudflare Pages with `public/_redirects` handling SPA routing; any static host works. Set the two Supabase environment variables in the host's build settings.
