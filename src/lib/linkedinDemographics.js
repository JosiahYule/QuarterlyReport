// Parser for LinkedIn audience exports.
//
// Two shapes arrive here, and both are handled by the same scan:
//
//   1. Campaign Manager "Demographics" exports (Analyze → Demographics →
//      Export) — one CSV per dimension, with a few report-metadata lines above
//      the real header row and columns like "Job Function, Impressions,
//      Clicks".
//   2. The Page analytics "Companies" export — one row per company, with
//      organic and paid metrics side by side ("Organic impressions", "Paid
//      impressions", "Paid clicks", …). Only the paid columns are of interest
//      here, since this feeds the Paid Media report.
//
// Both arrive with quoted fields containing commas ("Halifax, Nova Scotia
// Area"), thousands separators in counts, a UTF-8 BOM, and sometimes a
// trailing "Total" row — all absorbed here so the admin form can accept the
// file exactly as LinkedIn produced it.
import { parseCsvRecords } from "./formSubmissions.js";

// Canonical dimensions, in the order the report presents them.
//
// `layout` picks how the report draws a breakdown, and the two answer
// different questions. "bars" is for a handful of segments that partition the
// audience — job function, seniority — where each one's share of impressions
// is the story and the bars read as a distribution. "list" is for a roster of
// named accounts, where a share of 1.6% says nothing useful and the real
// question is which of them engaged; those are ranked by clicks and drawn as
// a table, so the ranking is visible in the numbers.

// a company that clicked twice is worth more attention than one served 400
// impressions that never did. Impressions break the tie, so the zero-click
// tail still leads with the companies that saw the ads most.
//
// This orders the stored rows, so it also decides which segments survive the
// MAX_SEGMENTS cut — the clickers are kept, not just the most-served.
//
// Exported because the report sorts with it too. Ranking only at import time
// would freeze whatever rule was in force the day a file was uploaded, so a
// change here would silently skip every breakdown already in the database.
