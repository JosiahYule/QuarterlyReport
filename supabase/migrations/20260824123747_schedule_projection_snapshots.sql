-- Capture projection snapshots on a schedule instead of on page loads.
--
-- Until now the only thing writing projection_snapshots was the browser:
-- useTrendsData's snapshotAllAgencies() fired whenever someone opened the
-- Trends tab. That made snapshot density a function of who happened to visit,
-- which is why the recorded history has weekend gaps and a five-day hole in
-- early August, and why AS and ADS went stale for weeks without anything
-- noticing. Every projection and every calibration factor is derived from this
-- series, so its density is the ceiling on how good the forecasts can get.
--
-- Doing it in the database keeps the whole job in one place: no edge function,
-- no service-role key in a scheduler, no network hop. The snapshot is a pure
-- copy of the current quarter's KPI row, which is already plain SQL.

-- pg_catalog, not cron: the extension is not relocatable and always installs
-- there, creating the cron schema for its own tables. This line originally
-- said "with schema cron", which only worked on the live database because
-- pg_cron was already enabled; a fresh rebuild failed on it.
create extension if not exists pg_cron with schema pg_catalog;

-- Which fiscal quarter (suffix + year label) a given date falls in. Mirrors
-- Q_DEFS/buildQuarter in src/config.js: the fiscal year starts in September,
-- and a quarter is labelled with the calendar year of its last day.
